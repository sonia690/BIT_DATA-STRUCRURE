Project 117: Stack and Queue Exercises
Description

This project demonstrates practical applications of stacks and queues in real-life scenarios.
It covers tasks such as mobile money operations, lab workflows, hospital patient queues, and client service management.
The project also includes algorithmic challenges like reversing a string using a stack and analyzing fairness using a queue.

Features

Stack Operations: Push, pop, peek, and undo functionality.

Queue Operations: Enqueue, dequeue, and determining positions in line.

Algorithmic Challenge: Reverse strings using stack data structure.

Theoretical Reflections: Understanding why stacks support undo but not fairness, and how FIFO ensures equality.
